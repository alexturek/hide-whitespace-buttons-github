# Add buttons to show/hide whitespace in diffs

Ever see diffs where 90% of the change is indentation, and it's hard to see what changed functionally?

Install this user script to add these buttons to diffs and Pull Requests.

Note: You can do this same thing with `git diff` in the command line by adding a `-w` flag!
